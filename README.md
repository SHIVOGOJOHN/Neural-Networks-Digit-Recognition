# Convolutional-Neural-Networks

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a type of deep learning model particularly well-suited for tasks involving spatial or grid-like data, such as images or sequences. CNNs are highly effective for visual recognition tasks because they can automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from data, capturing local patterns in ways traditional feedforward networks cannot.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview 
This is a beginner project involving digit recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the **MNIST** dataset. It includes data loading, model training, evaluation, and image prediction on a single digit image.
